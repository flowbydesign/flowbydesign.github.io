<dt>&#8220;One day... </dt>
<dd>
<p>as I had my stereo cranked up high, my nose glued to the song lyrics and my fingerprints trailing all over the sleeves, a sweet thought came to my mind.</p>
<p>*Wouldn't it be great to do this all day?</p>
<p>I glanced over to my bookshelf stuffed with regular sized jewel cases to ginormous irregular shaped cases. As I savored every beat &amp; riff and mesmerized over every word &amp; drawing, a light bulb lit.</p>
<p>*Wouldn't it be fun to make my own covers?</p>
<p>I started to put together my own mixed discs and make my own labels for each. I made sure the song list was in order and every title spelled correctly. As I smiled over my own creation, I had an epiphany.</p>
<p>*Wouldn't it be great to do this for a living? </p>
<p>It was that simple! I would design cd covers &amp; artists would send me a copy of my newest creation. I would get free music and artists would get custom designs. A great exchange it was. I was set...&#8221; </p>
<p>*Was this a fleeting thought or an aspiration? &nbsp; <a href="about.html" title="click to continue the story">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
